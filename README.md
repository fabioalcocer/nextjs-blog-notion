## notion-next-blog

Easy to manage personal blog built with Notion as content manager and Next for the frontend


## How it works

### 1. Create an integration in Notion

Go to: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations and create an integration. The only capability you will need is "Read content". Save your `secret` you are going to use it.

### 2. Create a database

In notion, create an empty file and add a database typing `/database` and selecting `Database - Full page`

### 3. Connect the database with the integration

Inside the database file, click on the three dots and in the connections option select the one that you created in the first step

### 4. Integrate the database to your code

Clone this repository and in the root of the project, create a file called `.env` with two keys `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`. For the `NOTION_TOKEN` key, you will need to add the secret you got in the first step. In `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` you need to put the ID of your database which you can take from the URL
